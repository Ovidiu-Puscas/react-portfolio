## 📋 **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) - ESSENTIAL**

### **1.1 Code Quality & Formatting**

**Tools:** ESLint + Prettier + VS Code Integration

**Implementation:**

- Configure ESLint for React 18, hooks, and accessibility
- Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Add VS Code settings for auto-format on save
- Configure rules for Error Boundary patterns

**Benefits:**

- Consistent code style across all 7 projects
- Catch React anti-patterns and potential bugs
- Automatic formatting eliminates style debates
- Improved accessibility compliance

**Deliverables:**

```
├── .eslintrc.js          # ESLint configuration
├── .prettierrc           # Prettier configuration
├── .prettierignore       # Files to ignore
└── .vscode/settings.json # Editor integration
```

### **1.2 Pre-commit Quality Gates**

**Tools:** Husky + lint-staged

**Implementation:**

- Install Husky for Git hooks
- Configure lint-staged for targeted file processing
- Set up pre-commit checks: lint, format, basic tests
- Add commit message linting (conventional commits)

**Benefits:**

- Prevents bad code from entering repository
- Fast feedback loop (catches issues locally)
- Enforces quality standards before CI/CD
- Saves CI/CD resources and time

**Git Workflow:**

```
Developer commits → Pre-commit hooks run →
Lint code → Format code → Run affected tests →
Allow commit if all pass
```

### **1.3 GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline**

**Tools:** GitHub Actions + Firebase Hosting

**Implementation:**

- Set up multi-stage pipeline
- Environment-specific deployments (staging/production)
- Automated testing on every pull request
- Automatic deployment on main branch merge

**Pipeline Stages:**

1. **Install & Cache** - Dependencies and build cache
2. **Code Quality** - ESLint, Prettier check
3. **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests
4. **Security** - Dependency vulnerability scan
5. **Build** - Production build with optimization
6. **Deploy** - Firebase hosting deployment
7. **Notify** - Slack/email notifications on failure

**Deliverables:**

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── ci-cd.yml         # Main pipeline
    ├── pr-check.yml      # Pull request validation
