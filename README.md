# React Portfolio - Project Library

A modern React portfolio showcasing various applications and projects with a **modular component architecture**. This repository contains a collection of React applications, each demonstrating different skills and technologies using reusable, maintainable component patterns.

## 🏗️ Modular Architecture

This portfolio follows a **component-driven development** approach with three levels of reusability:

### 📦 Global Components (`src/components/`)

Reusable components shared across the entire application:

- **SEO.jsx** - Dynamic meta tags and SEO optimization

### 🔗 Project-Shared Components (`src/projects/components/`)

Components shared between projects:

- **Title.jsx** - Consistent heading components (h1-h6)
- **Description.jsx** - Standardized description/paragraph component
- **ProjectCard.jsx** - Interactive project cards with hover effects
- **GameStats.jsx** - Configurable stats display with action buttons
- **Button.jsx** - Flexible button component with multiple variants

### 🎯 App-Specific Components

Each project maintains specialized components in its own folder for unique functionality.

## Features

- **Modern Card-Based Library**: Browse projects through an elegant card-based interface with hover effects and smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
